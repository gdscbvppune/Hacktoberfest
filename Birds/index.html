  <h3 class="margin">What Am I?</h3>
  <p>I am a bird. I fly high where the music takes me. I fly free in a world of love & hate. I sit in my nest; my comfort zone. I sit, watching the world from afar. Watching & wishing war would subside, And peace take its place. I fly to a place where only in my dreams, In my dreams, a world of happiness, A world where love could be enough. As a bird, I continue to grow, Unsure of where my wings will take me, But confident I can make a difference in this world so troubled and forlorn. When I'm old, when I'm wise, my wings are fully grown I will make a difference. I will help the birds with a tear in their wing, A damper on their spirits, Or a nest that's been broken by the strong winds of the Earth. But now as I am still growing, I'll stay in my nest, And when possible, fly to the far end of my branch, And as I work harder, and as I grow, I will get to the very reaches of the tree in which I nest. And while I'm still young, and while IÕm still small, I will love my fellow birds, And help them in their journey to the sky I will someday reach. For the sky is the limit, and I am a bird.</p>
